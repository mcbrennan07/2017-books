  <h3 style="text-align:center;" class="chernow">Prologue</h3>
	<p class="chernow">In late 2016, I read Ron Chernow’s Hamilton, the Alexander Hamilton biography which Lin Manuel-Miranda cited as his inspiration for the Broadway musical of the same name. The biography presented Hamilton’s life in a way that combined cogent narrative with fact-based interpretations of history. Chernow told the story of the dramatic, truly non-stop life that Hamilton dedicated to his country, but what I found most surprising was how tentative and uncertain the early union of states was in the early years of the republic. For example, the first few presidents weren’t sure how regal they should expect to be treated; Washington turned down the title of “your majesty”; Adams was ridiculed for his formal dress and affect, while Jefferson spurned frippery and rode around D.C. on his horse.</p>
	<p class="chernow">More substantively, during Washington’s terms, the Federal government had to work to establish legitimacy if it was to survive. Hamilton’s fight for the Federal government to assume states’ debts was not an overly technical, theoretical debate; if the larger states maintained their own debts to England, they would need to control trade, and they would have an incentive to raise import tariffs. For the Federal government to survive, it needed the funding that controlling imports would bring. In these and other ways, Hamilton’s fight for bureaucracy and Federal power was essential to keep the union together.</p>
	<p class="chernow">However, by the end of the Adams administration, the pendulum had swung the other way. Democratic Republicans, joined by revolutionaries who had just overthrown one monarchical institution, were disgusted by Adam’s smug formality and the growing Federal powers alike. Federalists, for their part, were horrified by the violence of the French Revolution and, perhaps more disturbing, the outspoken American contingent favoring the same. The Federalists enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts to jail journalists speaking such treasons. Events like the Whiskey Rebellion exacerbated this conflict, marking the first time the American government dispatched armed forces against its own populace. In those days, despite the party labels that had emerged, it wasn’t clear at all that these were two different parties that would swap power every eight years. On one side was a powerful government, and on the other side was a contingent that, it appeared, wanted to demolish it, violently or otherwise.</p>
	<p class="chernow">My takeaway for why the nation survived, based on this book, is Thomas Jefferson. As maligned as he is in Chernow’s Hamilton, Jefferson arguably saved the nation by failing to live up to his ideals. Before the presidency, Jefferson vociferously criticized the Federalists, praised the French revolution, and argued against a strong federal government. He even laid the foundation for the civil war by arguing that the states had ultimate supremacy over the Federal government. When he reached office, however, he did not dismantle Hamilton’s financial system. The union survived.</p>
	<p class="chernow">All of this is to say that Hamilton presented me with a very interesting picture of how a divided populace-- initially made up of people loyal only to their own states-- overcame massive ideological divides and produced an enduring nation. I wanted to turn, then, to the opposite. I chose two books on societal collapse: 1177 B.C. and Rubicon. Then, for a return to the lighter side, I selected The Swerve, which concerns Lucretius’ De Rerum Natura on the Enlightenment-- another example of a civilization on the rise instead of in decline, like Hamilton, though hopefully more on the cultural side rather than the political side.</p>

  	<h3 class="cline">1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed<br>Eric H. Cline</h3>
	<p class="cline">The Bronze Age didn’t picture very prominently in my education. Disney movies didn’t feature Prince Zannanza of Hatti or his fateful trip to Egypt, and the A.P. exam in high school didn’t require me to memorize who won the battle of Qadesh. Even my college major, in which relatively ancient texts like the Iliad were required reading, treated the so-called birth of Western civilization in Greece like the beginning of time. And yet, although Socrates lived in the early 400s B.C., thriving cities like Lothan and Mohenjo-Daro had working plumbing and flourishing trade as early as in the 26th century B.C. I think there is a certain sense in which civilizations prior to ~500 B.C. are treated as unimportant or trivial.</p>
	<p class="cline">This is one of the misconceptions Eric Cline battles in his scholarly and literary work, 1177 B.C., the Year Civilization Collapsed. Cline spends most of the book introducing several major civilizations that flourished in the Near East up to the late 1100s B.C. -- The New Kingdom of Egypt in the South, the city of Meggiddo by the Mediterranean Sea, the Bablyonians, the Hittites, the Mittani, the Cypriot, and the Myceneans. Excavation from these showed complex statuaries, ceramics, textiles, and other products. There were a variety of languages, and even schools dedicated to teaching scribes. These were not merely isolated city-states; there is evidence of widespread trade. A statute base in Egypt recounted a tour around the Mediterranean; letters have been preserved between merchants describing items being shipped. One shipwreck, likely on its way from Egypt through Ugarit to Mycenea, contained ten tons of raw copper, one ton of raw tin, and barrels of raw glass, barley, spices, resin, and wine. The ancient Near East had not only massive civilizations, but also a ‘global’ economy.</p>
	<p class="cline">At least, that is how things were in the 1200s. By 1050 B.C., all of these civilizations had been brought to their knees. The geographically massive empires of Hatti, Babylon, and Ugarit were replaced with smaller rural kingdoms. Widespread trade, written scholarship, and bronzeworking were no more. It would be hundreds of years before Mediterranean civilizations regained these characteristics on a widespread scale. So what happened to these prosperous, educated, artisinal, and globalized economies?</p> 
	<p class="cline">If you asked most scholars around thirty years ago, the answer would be “the Sea Peoples.” Egyptian and other texts reference a collection of peoples who swept in from the Western Mediterranean, smashing these great civilizations in battle. The Peleset, the Tjekker, the Shekelesh, the Shardana, the Danuna, the Weshesh-- these peoples from unknown origin and of disparate cultures allegedly swept in and wiped out these massive organizations. As Cline explores, however, a closer look reveals that the evidence we have of sea peoples may be less militaristic and more opportunistic. The archeological record, while still containing record of battles between the sea peoples and the indigenous Near Eastern populations, also shows more peaceful settlements and evidence of the sea peoples settling among extant populations.</p>
	<p class="cline">Cline argues that it was the complexity of the ‘globalized’ system itself that contributed to the downfall of these societies. During the late 1100s, these Near Eastern civilizations dealt with not only the Sea Peoples, but a variety of disasters: an “earthquake storm” as a fault line unzipped; climate change as evidenced by the pollen record causing widespread drought and famine; internal rebellion as evidenced in the archeological record; and, as a result of all these, the collapse of international trade. Civilizations in this period showed the ability to weather these problems, but Cline suggests that a domino effect may have occurred decreasing the ability of these civilizations to survive. The complexity of the system itself may have led to its fragility: once trade collapsed, the nations could not survive disasters on their own. The ability to trade was what helped these civilizations grow, and when one area encountered a drought or attack, it could turn to its allies for assistance. When all of the major civilizations were afflicted by disaster, and the lines of communication and commerce were cut, the size of these civilizations could not be maintained.</p>
	<p class="cline">I came to this book to understand how interconnected, powerful, erudite civilizations could collapse so completely that they didn’t rate a mention in 23 years of education. Certainly, many of these concerns overlap with today: climate change, rebellion, war, and our present reliance on the high production of our crops and on our continued international trade. We shouldn’t take for granted that future history books will include our civilizations.</p>
	<p class="cline">Beyond this conclusion, however, this was a fascinating book if only for the stories: the man who accidentally uncovered a millenia-old sword; the mighty Hittite king Suppiluliuma who believed a letter claiming that the widowed Queen of Egypt wanted to marry his son, only to have that son be murdered on the trip; the archaeologist who proved the existence of a city his peers believed to be a myth; the concubine who faced a court-martial for having the Pharoh’s throat slit so that her son could take the throne; and so on. One of my most striking conclusions from this book was how human these people were and how complex their politics were. I will definitely be returning to the Bronze Age in future readings.</p>

	<h3 class="holland">Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic<br>Tom Holland</h3>
	<p class="holland">Rubicon begins with the sun setting behind the Apennine mountains and a chill in the air on that cold January 10th before Caesar crossed the eponymous river. The temperature change from Cline’s staid, deduction-driven scholarship to Tom Holland’s confident narrative was jarring but not altogether unpleasant. (After all, Cline was working from far fewer source materials; Holland has so much to choose from that he started with a disclaimer that his source material at times disagrees with itself.) Rubicon is, at its heart, a narrative, and the protagonist is the Roman people.</p>
	<p class="holland">The book presented a simultaneously alien and familiar world with the Roman republic. Holland helps the reader understand how, to the Romans, the destruction of an ancient civilization might be a triumph; how individuals could be at once glorified and yet subject to suspicion if their power grew too great. The Romans had a massive divide between rich and poor, to be sure, but their fierce pride in the Roman values of freedom, citizenship, and success meant that a soldier boy from Arpinum could grow up to become a consul seven times over, and that an ancient family name could fade in reputation after just a generation or two of indolence. Prominent men sometimes ended their term in public office with a trial that would end their careers.</p>
	<p class="holland">Holland traces the destruction of the Republic back to the first few cracks: the brutal and divisive murder of the Gracchi; the expansion of Roman rule over conquered lands by permitting publicani to exploit them, leading the growth of the Roman version of “big business”; and, of course, the reign of Sulla. Holland details the rise of Sulla and the fateful moment that Marius, outmaneuvering him, sent a single man to take command of Sulla’s army. The moment eerily foreshadowed Cato’s strategy of forcing men like Caesar into a corner and, as Caesar did later, Sulla marched on Rome. The Senate house burned, proscription lists named Sulla’s enemies the enemies of the state, and reforms slashed the power of the populist tribunates. And, for not the first time, a dictator ruled in Rome under the guise of being the defender of the constitution.</p>
	<p class="holland">Sulla, ultimately, stepped down, but he had laid the groundwork for the next generation of over-reachers. Crassus built non-political financial power, while Pompey, the would-be second Alexander, obtained unprecedented powers as proconsul for his war in the East. Catiline established a new precedent for non-political power with his rebellion, although it was crushed. The power of trials began to recede, as men like Clodius traded backroom favors for acquittals. Politically-motivated street violence grew, and Cicero’s home burned. With each new scandal or turn of events in Rome, Holland described a nation chipping away at the power of the rule of law. The culmination of all this was the unexpected alliance between Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus: for the first time in a long time, power in Rome had been consolidated to just three men. The legions they earned with their exertion of power were, once again, unprecedented in size and power.</p>
	<p class="holland">In the months leading up the crossing of the Rubicon, the situation in Rome was eerily familiar. Pompey, like Marius, was well-respected in Rome and felt confident in his power. Caesar and his legions warred not too far from Rome, not unlike Sulla, and yet he was targeted-- in this case by Cato-- and stood to be forced into trial and political destruction despite his massive military success. And, like Sulla, he marched on Rome. Like Sulla, he painted himself as a constitutionalist. But unlike Sulla, he pardoned his enemies. Unlike Sulla, Caesar sought the reality of power, not its office. This is the philosophy that led Octavian, many years later, to resign his office while remaining the undisputed autocrat of Rome. Although this reflection skims over a great deal of the intervening warfare and angling, this is the genius of Caesar and Augustus: they understood the people of Rome, understood the importance and power of branding and fear, and understood the power of precedent. They wielded power, not by raising themselves to the standards of the Roman people, but by providing the Roman people with the hope that they could once again rise to the glory of their ancestors.</p>
	<p class="holland">Ultimately, republicanism died in Rome when the people were ready for it to die. In prior generations, over-reaching men were shouted down from their pedestals. But one by one, men like Sulla, Crassus, and Pompey obtained and kept near-universal claim and greater and greater unprecedented powers. Bit by bit, the power of law paled before the exertions of non-political power by Catiline, Crassus, Clodius, and ultimately, Augustus. Brick by brick, precedent and tradition made way for the simple desire for an end to war. Autocracy came to Rome as a savior after a long period of decline and the Roman people, weary as they were, accepted it.</p>

	<h3 class="greenblatt">The Swerve: How the World Became Modern<br>Stephen Greenblatt</h3>
	<p class="greenblatt">After reading two books on the successive falls of great civilizations, I picked up <em>The Swerve</em>, an exploration of the revival of one classical test in particular and, more broadly, the revival of a cultural idea that led to the Enlightenment. I had expected <em>Rubicon</em> to be a biography of Julius Caesar, and was surprised to find it was a broad cultural analysis of the fall of Rome; conversely, I expected <em>The Swerve</em> to be a decentralized analysis of the transition from the Dark Ages to the Renaissance, and I was equally surprised to find that it was all but a biography of one pre-Renaissance humanist, Poggio Bracciolini.</p>
